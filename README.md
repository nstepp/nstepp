These repositories are mostly an archive for myself, and most are very old. Unfortunately,
all of the interesting code I've written since about 2010 is proprietary and can't be shared.

To get an idea of what I've been working on, see what comes up on
[google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P65jJT0AAAAJ), or see my profile on
[researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nigel-Stepp).
